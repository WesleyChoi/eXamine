# eXamine

Harnessing the power of facial recognition, eXamine is a tool for exam invigilators to use to help with ID verifications prior to examinations. As a result of classes moving online, verifying the students in a call with their student IDs is a necessary but time-consuming process to combat cheating. In addition, the requirement for students to display their ID to their webcam raises great vulnerabilities in respect to privacy and security. eXamine autotomizes this process, expediting the procedure, and ultimately reduces security and privacy risks.
